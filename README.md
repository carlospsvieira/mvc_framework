# mvc_framework

My PHP MVC framework setup (Object oriented)

- Architects all needed folders for a PHP MVC framework (MVC, Libraries, Helpers, Config, Public, etc)
- Rewrites engines and rules for Apache server, if any other, it may be adjusted to your preference in .htaccess files.
- URL methods construct in Core class.
- Loads MVC functionalities all together, application ready.
